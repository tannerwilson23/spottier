make sure you have "convolved_grid_with_vsini.pkl" in the same directory. After the first run ~20mins will save interpolator as a pkl saving time when running again.
Also need to be in isochrones environment: https://isochrones.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Running models.py will create some spotted spectra (size changes the number that it attempts to make but will fail 3/4 of the time so will display how many it actually created)
This will create 3 pkls of arrays "norm_spectra, norm_spectra_e and injected_params". Spectra arrays will have shape (number of spectra created x 8575). injected params will have shape (number of spectra x 11) 

injected params has order: [x_spot_draws,fspot,teff,logg,meh,prot,i_deg,log10_vsini,age,tau_conv,mass,logl]

Following this it will attempt to fit a set amount of the spectra with the spotted and non spotted models.
Varying starts and E will change the number of times you fit the spectra from different inits and the number of spectra you try to fit respectively.

This will then create 6 arrays that are dumped as pkls:

res_spotted
res_non_spotted
opt_spotted
opt_non_spotted
inits_spotted
inits_non_spotted

res* should have shape (starts x E x 2)  have the full_output = True dictionary of fitting information + the inits
opt* and inits* should have shape (stars x E x number of parameters fitting) - 4 for nonspotted and 6 for spotted

If you want to fit a single spectra it's probably best to use "fit_speccy(i,normalised_data,normalised_data_e ,params_injected)" where normalised data etc. are the full arrays of all the spectra and i is the index of the star you want to fit - the results arrays aren't currently set up to take a single star.
